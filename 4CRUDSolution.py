### 4. CRUD Operations Simulation

# Simulate basic CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) operations for a collection of "users".
 
# - Create a list `users` to store user records in the format `{"id": int, "name": str, "favorite_color": str}`.
# For example users = [{"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "favorite_color": "Blue"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "favorite_color": "Red"}]
# - Implement the following routes:
# 1. `GET /users`: Return the full list of users.
# 2. `POST /users`: Accept JSON data with `name` and `favorite_color`, assign a unique `id` to each new user, and add them to the `users` list. Return the new user data.
# 3. `GET /users/<user_id>`: Return the user data for the specified `user_id`. If not found, return a `404` error.
# 4. `PUT /users/<user_id>`: Accept JSON data to update the name and/or age of the user with the given `user_id`. Return the updated user data.
# 5. `DELETE /users/<user_id>`: Remove the user with the specified `user_id` and return a confirmation message.

# - **Challenge**: Add validation to prevent duplicate names in the list and return a `409 Conflict` status if a user with the same name already exists.
